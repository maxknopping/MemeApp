<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<br>

<p>This policy describes the information we process to support MemeClub, offered by MemeClub, Inc. You can find additional tools and information in the MemeClub Settings.</p>

<br>

<h2>I. What kinds of information do we collect?</h2>

<br>

<p>To provide the MemeClub Products, we must process information about you. The types of information we collect depend on how you use our Products.</p>

<br>

<h3>Things you and others do and provide.</h3>

<br>

<p>Information and content you provide. We collect the content, communications and other information you provide when you use our Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or communicate with others. This can include information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created. Our systems automatically process content and communications you and others provide to analyze context and what's in them for the purposes described below.</p>

<br>

<p>Data with special protections: You can choose to provide information in your MemeClub profile fields about your religious views, political views, who you are "interested in," or your health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject to special protections under the laws of your country.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Networks and connections.</strong> We collect information about the people, accounts, hashtags and groups you are connected to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as people you communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also collect contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know and for the other purposes listed below.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Your usage.</strong> We collect information about how you use our Products, such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features you use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; and the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts or other content you view on our Products.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Information about transactions made on our Products.</strong> If you use our Products for purchases or other financial transactions, we collect information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card information; other account and authentication information; and billing, shipping and contact details.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Things others do and information they provide about you.</strong> We also receive and analyze content, communications and information that other people provide when they use our Products. This can include information about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you, send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact information.</p>

<br>

<h3>Device Information</h3>

<br>

<p>As described below, we collect information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or features you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>

<br>

<p>Information we obtain from these devices includes:</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Device attributes:</strong> information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Device operations:</strong> information about operations and behaviors performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from bots).</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts you use.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Device signals:</strong> Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons, and cell towers.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Data from device settings:</strong> information you allow us to receive through device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS location or photos.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Network and connections:</strong> information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices that are nearby or on your network.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Cookie data:</strong> data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings.</p>

<br>

<h3>Information from partners.</h3>

<br>

<p>Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information through MemeClub Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the Like button), MemeClub Login, our APIs and SDKs. These partners provide information about your activities off MemeClub—including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you have a MemeClub account or are logged into MemeClub. We also receive information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.</p>

<br>

<p>Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or through third parties they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us.</p>

<br>

<h2>II. How do we use this information?</h2>

<br>

<p>We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to provide and support the MemeClub Products and related services described in the MemeClub Terms. Here's how:</p>

<br>

<h3>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.</h3>

<br>

<p>We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to personalize features and content (including your Explore Feed and MemeClub Home Feed) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or jousts you may be interested in or topics you may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you, we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the data we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products; and the people, places, or things you're connected to and interested in on and off our Products.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Information across MemeClub Products and devices:</strong> We connect information about your activities on different MemeClub Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all MemeClub Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on MemeClub that includes people you follow on MemeClub or communicate with using MemeClub Direct-Messages.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Location-related information:</strong> We use location-related information-such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can be based on things like precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and others' use of MemeClub Products.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Product research and development:</strong> We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Ads and other sponsored content:</strong> We use the information we have about you-including information about your interests, actions and connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and personalize ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the MemeClub Settings.</p>

<br>

<h3>Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.</h3>

<br>

<p>We use the information we have (including your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services, and understand the types of people who use their services and how people interact with their websites, apps, and services.</p>

<br>

<h3>Promote safety, integrity and security.</h3>

<br>

<p>We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of MemeClub Products. For example, we use data we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when someone needs help.</p>

<br>

<h3>Communicate with you.</h3>

<br>

<p>We use the information we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.</p>

<br>

<h3>Research and innovate for social good.</h3>

<br>

<p>We use the information we have (including from research partners we collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.</p>

<br>

<h2>III. How is this information shared?</h2>

<br>

<p>Your information is shared with others in the following ways:</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Sharing on MemeClub Products</strong></p>

<br>

<p><strong>People and accounts you share and communicate with</strong></p>

<br>

<p>When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you post on MemeClub, you select the audience for the post, such as all of your friends or the public. Similarly, when you use MemeClub Direct-Messenger to communicate with people, those people can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions you have taken on our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content.</p>

<br>

<p>Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This includes your MemeClub username; any information you share with a public audience; information in your public profile on MemeClub. You, other people using MemeClub, and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other MemeClub Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Content others share or reshare about you</strong></p>

<br>

<p>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.</p>

<br>

<p>People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can report the content.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</strong></p>

<br>

<p><strong>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</strong></p>

<br>

<p>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on MemeClub, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may receive your list of MemeClub friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other information about your MemeClub friends from you, or information about any of your MemeClub followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.</p>

<br>

<p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of MemeClub will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>New owner.</strong></p>

<br>

<p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>

<br>

<h3>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</h3>

<br>

<p>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products by using MemeClub services. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties we share information with:</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Partners who use our analytics services.</strong></p>

<br>

<p>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the MemeClub Products. For example, Page admins receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong></p>

<br>

<p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which MemeClub ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Measurement partners.</strong></p>

<br>

<p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</strong></p>

<br>

<p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong></p>

<br>

<p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests.</strong></p>

<br>

<h2>IV. How can I manage or delete information about me?</h2>

<br>

<p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data.</p>

<br>

<p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and MemeClub Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs.</p>

<br>

<p>When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and messages, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the MemeClub Settings.</p>

<br>

<h2>VI. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</h2>

<br>

<p>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>

<br>

<h2>VII. How to contact MemeClub with questions</h2>
