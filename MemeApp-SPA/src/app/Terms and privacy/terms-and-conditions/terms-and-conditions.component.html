  <br><br>

  These Terms of Use govern your use of MemeClub and provide information about the MemeClub's Service, outlined below. When you create a MemeClub account or use MemeClub, you agree to these terms.
  <br><br>

  The MemeClub Service is one of the MemeClub Products, provided to you by MemeClub.co. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and MemeClub.co.
  <br><br>

  <strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION BELOW.</strong>
  <br><br>

  <span class="text_heading">The MemeClub Service</span>
  <br><br>

  We agree to provide you with the MemeClub Service. The Service includes all of the MemeClub products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance MemeClub's mission: To bring you closer to the people and memes you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):
  <br><br>

  <ul>
    <li>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, meme, and share.</li>
    <br>
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences of memes you care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you; especially in correspondence to the art of the meme. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience MemeClub, based on things you and others do on and off MemeClub.
    <br><br>

    <li>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment for straight memeing.</li>
    <br>
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law enforcement.
    <br><br>

    <li>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community of memers.</li>
    <br>
    Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community of memers. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service to the central memeing community.
    <br><br>

    <li>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</li>
    <br>
    We use data from MemeClub and other Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on MemeClub.
    <br><br>

    <li>Research and innovation.</li>
    <br>
    We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our MemeClub community.
    <br><br>
  </ul>

    <li>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it.</li>

    Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings).

  <strong>Additional Rights We Retain</strong>
  <br><br>

  <ul>

    <br>

  </ul>

  <strong>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</strong>
  <br><br>

  <ul>
    <li>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use, if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult maxknopping@memeclub.co
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree," will still apply even after your account is terminated or deleted.</li>
    <br>
  </ul>

  <strong>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</strong>
  <br><br>

  Our agreement
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.</li>
    <br>

    <li>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</li>
    <br>

    <li>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.</li>
    <br>

    <li>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</li>
    <br>
  </ul>

  <strong>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement</strong>
  <br><br>

  <ul>
    <li>This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</li>
    <br>

    <li>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.</li>
    <br>

    <li>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</li>
    <br>
  </ul>

  <strong>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens</strong>
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</li>
    <br>

    <li>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our Service.</li>
    <br>

    <li>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible ("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content, information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.</li>
    <br>

    <li>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</li>
    <br>
  </ul>

  <strong>How We Will Handle Disputes</strong>
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or MemeClub ("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other MemeClub users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</li>
    <br>

    <li>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims" court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</li>
    <br>

    The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court: disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of our 
    <a href="platform_policy">Platform Policy</a>, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.
    <br>

    This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
    <br>

    You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email address or phone number you use for your MemeClub account to the admin MemeClub account.
    <br>

    <li>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email address or phone number you use for your MemeClub account, a detailed description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should be sent to the MemeClub admin. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address you use with your MemeClub account, or other appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</li>
    <br>

    <li>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New Jersey or a state court located in Essex County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.</li>
    <br>

    <li>The laws of the State of New Jersey, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</li>
    <br>
  </ul>

  <strong>Unsolicited Material</strong>
  <br><br>

  We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you will not be permitted to usage of MemeClub.co or its affiliated app.
